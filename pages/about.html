    <h3>A Bit About Me |</h3>
    <p>Danica Stitz, DipWSET, has more than fifteen years of industry experience across retail sales (Best Cellars), distributor training and education (The Winebow Group), to premium wine sales (V.O.S. Selections, M.S. Walker). Along the way, she has developed training materials and programs, and conducted hundreds of training sessions for salespeople, consumers and trade alike, helping to boost wine confidence and knowledge, and bring wines to life for customers.

<p>Before 'officially' entering the wine industry, she specialized in Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology (MA, NYU Institute of Fine Arts; BA, UC Berkeley) with a focus on Greek drinking vessels and Roman drinking parties in Pompeii. Along with completing the rigorous WSET Diploma in Wine & Spirits, she holds the credentials of Certified Specialist of Wine from the Society of Wine Educators and French Wine Society.
</p>
<p>When not strategizing for her clients, she plays with her energized Sheltie "Katie", listens to vinyl, watercolors and loves to be out on the water (a true Pacific Northwesterner!). Oh, and vegetable gardening. Nothing beats cultivating something really tasty from scratch.</p>
